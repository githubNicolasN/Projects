#Python Chatbot project featuring OpenAI and Streamlit framework

  This is my take on a chatbot project that i've made in order to learn more about working with APIs and frameworks for user interfaces
  
  I used the OpenAI API in order to make prompt requests to their server and receive answers from their GPT 3.5 model. 
  I've also made a simple user interface using the streamlit framework and hid my OpenAI access key in a hidden .env file.
  
  If you'd like to try this yourselv you need to make a .env file in the same directory with the following line: API_KEY = Type your OpenAi API Key without quotations here
